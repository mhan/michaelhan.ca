## About Me

I am a software developer searching for that fine line between coding quickly
and coding thoughtfully. I am experienced in Objective-C and Javascript, and I have
dabbled in Ruby, Java, C, C#, C++, and Scheme.


## Experience

### Software Architect @ ForeSee (2008-Present)

In 2008 I joined ForeSee as a developer working on the initial release
of SessionReplay, a Javascript tool that records how users interact with a website
and produces high fidelity movies to analyze usability issues.

In early 2010, I transitioned to iOS development and have been working primarily on 
iOS projects ever since.

#### Projects

**SessionReplay for iOS**

An SDK that provides similar functionality to the JS version of SessionReplay. Recordings
are made by taking screenshots of the app (on a background thread) and creating mp4 movies
from those screenshots. Together with recorded metadata, such as touches, a full recording 
is produced that is viewed through a Flash based player.

Learned a lot about Objective-C, its dynamic runtime, performance analysis using 
Instruments, and a variety of built-in Cocoa frameworks on this project.

**Trigger for iOS**

An SDK that provides developers a mechanism to invite their users to participate
in satisfaction surveys.

Though this was a relatively simple project, it taught me a lot about designing APIs,
and the importance of deciding what functionality to expose, how to name and describe
that functionality and the pitfalls of not having a proper deprecation strategy.

**Executive Portal Site**

Took a small hiatus from iOS development to level-up my JS skills by contributing
a custom DatePicker view with Backbone for a new customer facing portal site.

**Location-based survey panel app (prototype)**

Prototyped a iOS app that used location services to track a users proximity
to a physical store to try and determine whether the user entered and exited that store.
Developed a number of heuristics based mostly on location accuracy to determine whether
someone actually entered and exited a store.

**Heatmap processor**

Created a Java service to compute and render touch and scroll heatmaps 
from the metadata recorded by SessionReplay.


### Developer @ Nitobi (2006-2008)

I spent 2 years at Nitobi working primarily with Javascript, contributing to
CompleteUI, a suite of JS components.

#### Projects

**TreeGrid for CompleteUI**

A Javascript spreadsheet component that supported nested, hierarchical data.

**Calendar for CompleteUI**

A highly configurable Javascript datepicker component for CompleteUI.


## Education

### University of British Columbia (2000-2005)

B.Sc.in Computer Science and a minor in Philosophy.
